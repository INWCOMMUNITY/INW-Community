# App-First Development (Default)

For the meantime, default focus is on the **mobile app** and **admin**. Website edits are allowed when explicitly requested.

## Default work areas

- **apps/mobile/** – Mobile app (Expo/React Native)
- **apps/admin/** – Admin dashboard
- **packages/** – database, types, design-tokens
- **apps/main/src/app/api/** – API routes (when needed for mobile/admin)

## Website (apps/main)

- Do not modify website layout, format, or UI unless the user explicitly requests it
- API additions in `apps/main` are fine when needed for mobile/admin
