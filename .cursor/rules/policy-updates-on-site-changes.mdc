# Policy Updates on Site Changes

When making changes to the site, mobile app, admin, or API that affect:

- **Data collection** (new forms, tracking, cookies, analytics)
- **Payments or subscriptions** (Stripe flows, pricing, billing)
- **User features** (rewards, delivery, messaging, auth)
- **Third-party services** (new integrations, webhooks)
- **Security practices** (auth, encryption, storage)

**Suggest** relevant updates to:

- **Terms of Service** (`apps/main/src/lib/terms-content.ts`, terms page)
- **Privacy Policy** (`apps/main/src/app/privacy/page.tsx`, PDF route, export script)

## What to suggest

- New sections or subsections when adding features (e.g., rewards policy, local delivery)
- Revisions to existing clauses (e.g., security measures, third-party services)
- Date updates (`Last Updated`) when policies change

## Policy file locations

- Terms: `apps/main/src/lib/terms-content.ts` (source of truth for page + PDF)
- Privacy: `apps/main/src/app/privacy/page.tsx`, `api/policies/privacy/pdf/route.ts`, `scripts/export-policy-pdfs.ts`
